### Comtrya! I'm Andrea, a spirited Full Stack Developer and Teaching Assistant

I do have a [portfolio](https://andrearene.github.io/AndreaRene/), but here's the TLDR:

- 🌐 Passionate about web development and coding education.
- 👩‍🏫 Mentor and guide in a full stack development bootcamp.
- 🎓 Currently expanding knowlege working towards a certification in AWS.
- 🖖 Sci-fi and fantasy enthusiast - lover of Star Trek, Harry Potter, and more.
- 🎮 Avid gamer and Disney fan, with a keen interest in anime, manga, and graphic novels.
- 🌟 Aspiring to transition into a developer role in an innovative company.
- 📚 Lifelong learner, constantly evolving and embracing new tech challenges.
- 💼 Open to collaborations and new opportunities. Let's connect!
  <br/>
  <br/>

## I did some pretty awesome stuff

- Certificate in full stack development through UT Austin.
- Earned at least 100% on all of the assignments and group projects.
- Certificate - Scientific Computing with Python through freecodecamp.org.
- Certificate - Foundational C# with Microsoft.
- Working towards AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

Special note: I have a love-hate relationship with the challenges I completed to earn my Python certification. They really pushed, but looking back, I'm glad they did. I'm genuinely proud of the solutions I came up with. Call them a testament to both my stick-to-it-ive-ness and creativity. You can see them on my [Replit](https://replit.com/@AndreaRene)!
